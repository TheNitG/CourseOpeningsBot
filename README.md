# CourseOpeningsBot
CourseOpeningsBot is a discord bot made using Python. It serves the same functionalities as the [CourseOpenings Application](https://github.com/TheNitG/CourseOpenings) that can determine if a certain course (by CRN) is open or closed. If the course is closed, it will keep checking and notify when the course is open by pinging you. This application uses multi-threading to let you search for multiple classes at once and notify you when multiple classes are open. The goal of this project is to be an open-source alternative to paid sites that tell you when a course is available. This application is currently intended for Virginia Tech Courses and won't work for other colleges.\

It can also check the day's data of any stock available on Yahoo Finance and can create candlestick charts from the data.\

You can also play tic-tac-toe against an AI and solve sudoku puzzles with this bot.
